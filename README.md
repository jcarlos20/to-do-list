# Instructions

Here is the design for your reference https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hULJFyAJSl1hRAuZXeVuwLYCCKXeuRIw/view?usp=sharing

For the drag and drop functionality, you should use DnD Kit (https://dndkit.com/?ref=reactpractice.dev)

Kanban-style dashboard to manage to-dos, the user can drag and drop to-dos from one column to others and mark them as "To do", "In Progress" or "Done".

- the to-dos must be defined as objects
- app should have three columns: "To do", "In progress", "Done"
- users can drag and drop cards from one column to the other
- to-dos status should be updated when cards move over
- users can add tasks by typing into an input above the columns
- users can delete tasks by dragging and dropping over a "trash" area at the bottom of the columns

Focus on the functionality, making sure the state of each to-do is handled correctly. CSS is not priority, but feel free to stylish
